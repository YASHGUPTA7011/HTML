                <h3>

                1. **Definition**: Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere, which can affect human health and the environment.<br>
                
                2. **Sources**: Major sources include vehicle emissions, industrial discharges, burning fossil fuels, agricultural practices, and household products.<br>
                
                3. **Health Effects**: Exposure to air pollutants can lead to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, allergies, and even premature death.<br>
                
                4. **Types of Pollutants**: Common pollutants include particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).<br>
                
                5. **Environmental Impact**: Air pollution contributes to climate change, acid rain, and harm to wildlife and ecosystems.<br>
                
                6. **Vulnerable Populations**: Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly at risk from air pollution.<br>
                
                7. **Prevention Measures**: Solutions include transitioning to renewable energy, enhancing public transportation, implementing stricter emissions standards, and increasing green spaces in urban areas.<br>
                
                8. **Global Challenge**: Air pollution is a significant global issue, requiring collaborative efforts for effective management and policy changes.<br>
